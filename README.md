A quick comparison of Rust and Python for OpenCV development. The task here is to load an image and find some features, and display them

Python is easier for experimentation (especially with Matplotlib), Rust provides more confidence in what is going on with better typing (And allows in-place modification). It is annoying that because calls to the underlying library are `unsafe` it needs constant `?` or `.unwrap()`, also Rust needs some time to compile.
